# Text Analyzer - React Application

## Overview

The **Text Analyzer** is a simple and powerful React web application that allows users to analyze the content of any text they input. It provides real-time statistics such as the number of unique words and character count, along with a search-and-replace feature. The app also includes undo, redo, and reset functionalities to manage text modifications effectively.

## Features

- **Undo and Redo Functionality**: Users can undo or redo changes to the text.
- **Reset**: Clear all text and reset the application to its initial state.
- **Live Preview**: The app shows the updated text with highlighted changes in real time.

## Technologies Used

## How to Run the Project Locally

To get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine, follow these steps.

## Features Overview

### 1. **Text Analysis**

Once the user starts typing in the text area, the application dynamically counts:
- **Unique Words**: Number of distinct words, case-insensitive.
- **Character Count**: Number of characters, excluding spaces and punctuation.

### 2. **Search and Replace**

Users can enter a search term and a replace term in the respective input fields. When the **Replace All** button is clicked, all occurrences of the search term are replaced with the replace term, and the replaced words are highlighted.

### 3. **Undo and Redo**

- The **Undo** button reverts the last text change.
- The **Redo** button reapplies the reverted changes.

### 4. **Reset**

- The **Reset** button clears the text input field, search term, replace term, and resets the application.

### 5. **Live Preview with Highlighting**

Replaced words are highlighted in the live preview section, making it easier for users to track changes.

## Bonus Features

- **Live Highlighting**: All replaced terms are highlighted using `<mark>` tags, allowing for clear visualization of the changes made.
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: The app supports keyboard shortcuts for undo (Ctrl + Z) and redo (Ctrl + Y).
